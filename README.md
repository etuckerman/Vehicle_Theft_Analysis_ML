# Vehicle Theft Analysis with Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains code and data for exploring machine learning algorithms applied to a dataset named `cwdata.csv`. The dataset contains the following features with corresponding labels:

- Income
- Area
- Employed
- Home Owner
- Make
- Model
- Gender
- Age
- Colour
- Stolen

## Dataset Cleaning

The dataset `cwdata.csv` was initially dirty and required cleaning. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

Several supervised learning algorithms were applied to the cleaned dataset, including:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Random Forest

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to assess the performance of each algorithm.

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning algorithms were also applied to the dataset, including:

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering

The effectiveness of these algorithms was evaluated using appropriate clustering metrics such as silhouette score and inertia.
